A few things to note about this thing
The maxwell model was of course ripped from another source
Song you can play is from weebl's stockmarket, I might replace it with a copyright-free song if that actually becomes an issue
meow from freesound, you probably recognize it from minecraft lmao
Isometric viewing makes him look weird btw, if you wanna see what it'll actually look like then make sure you're in perspective view

THINGS TO ADD/FIX
The whisker texture doesn't properly show as transparent in-game despite it showing properly in unity
And I'm not going to delete the whiskers, so, uh, yeah
Also, the funny cat is the wrong way around when lying down on your desk in-game, and I have no idea how to reorient it correctly
I also want you to be able to pet it, which is why there's a maxwell inside maxwell, it's meant to play the meow sound but it don't work
I think that's it, might wanna put more into this stupid ass holdable later but for now, this is all
